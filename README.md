# Inertia Identification Minimal Examples

This repository contains a minimal working MATLAB example of the methods described in:

*Smooth Parameterization of Rigid-Body Inertia* by Rucker and Wensing ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9690029e))

and

*Geometric Robot Dynamic Identification: A Convex Programming Approach* by Lee, Wensing, and Park ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8922724), [supplemental repo](https://github.com/alex07143/Geometric-Robot-DynID))

The repository requires you to have [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) installed and accessible in your MATLAB path. 

After pulling down the code, be sure to pull in the submodule using `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Please email me at [pwensing@nd.edu](mailto:pwensing@nd.edu) if you have any issues, or feel free to open an issue.
